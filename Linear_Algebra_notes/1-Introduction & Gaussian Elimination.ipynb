    "## Elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "The method starts by substracting multiples of the first equation from the other equations. It subtracted multiples of each row from the rows beneath and reached the triangular system and then these equations can by solved by back-substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following is the original system:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*} \n",
    "2u + v + w &= 5 \\\\\n",
    "4u - 6v + 0w &= -2 \\\\ \n",
    "-2u + 7v + 2w &= 9\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to find the unknown values of u, v, and w. Substract 2 times the first equation from the second and substract -1 times the first equation from the third. We got the equivalent system:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*} \n",
    "2u + v + w &= 5 \\\\\n",
    "- 8v - 2w &= -12 \\\\ \n",
    "8v + 3w &= 14\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient 2 in the first equation is the **first pivot**. The pivot for the second stage of elimination is −8. We now ignore the first equation. A multiple of the second equation will be subtracted from the remaining equations (in this case there is only the third one) so as to eliminate v. We add the second equation to the third or, in other words, we subtract −1 times the second equation from the third. We then get the *triangular system*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*} \n",
    "2u + v + w &= 5 \\\\\n",
    "- 8v - 2w &= -12 \\\\ \n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This system is solved backward, bottom to top. In this example, forward elimination produced the **pivots 2, −8, 1**. It subtracted multiples of each row from the rows beneath, It reached the “triangular” system, which is solved in reverse order: Substitute each newly computed value into the equations that are waiting. The forward step is finished when the system is triangular; equation n contains only the last unknown multiplied by the last pivot. Backsubstitution yields the complete solution in the opposite order—beginning with the last unknown, then solving for the next to last, and eventually for the first.By definition, **pivots cannot be zero**. We need to divide by them. **Pivots multiplied will give det(A)**: -16 in this case, where A is the matrix of coefficients of the original system."
