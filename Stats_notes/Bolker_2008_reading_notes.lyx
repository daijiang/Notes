\begin_layout Subsection
Classical frequentist
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Classical statistics, which are part of the broader frequentist paradigm,
 are the kind of statistics typically presented in introductory statistics
 classes.
 For a specific experimental procedure (such as drawing cards or flipping
 coins), you calculate the probability of a particular outcome, which is
 defined as 
\emph on
the long-run average frequency of that outcome in a sequence of repeated
 experiments
\emph default
.
 Next you calculate a p-value, defined as the probability of that outcome
 or any more extreme outcome given a specified null hypothesis.
 If this so-called tail probability is small, then you reject the null hypothesi
s: otherwise, you fail to reject it.
 But you don’t accept the alternative hypothesis if the tail probability
 is large, you just fail to reject the null hypothesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A frequentist would translate this biological question into statistics as
 “what is the probability that I would observe a result this extreme, or
 more extreme, given the sampling procedure?”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Working statisticians will tell you that it is better to focus on estimating
 the values of biologically meaningful parameters and finding their confidence
 limits rather than worrying too much about whether p is greater or less
 than 0.05 (Yoccoz, 1991; Johnson, 1999; Osenberg et al., 2002) — although
 Stephens et al.
 (2005) remind us that hypothesis testing can still be useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Likelihood
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most modern statistics uses an approach called maximum likelihood estimation,
 or approximations to it.
 For a particular statistical model, maximum likelihood finds the set of
 parameters (e.g.
 seed removal rates) that makes the observed data (e.g.
 the particular outcomes of predation trials) most likely to have occurred.
 Based on a model for both the deterministic and stochastic aspects of the
 data, we can compute the likelihood (the probability of the observed outcome)
 given a particular choice of parameters.
 We then find the set of parameters that makes the likelihood as large as
 possible, and take the resulting maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) as
 our best guess at the parameters.
 For mathematical convenience, we often work with the logarithm of the likelihoo
d (the log-likelihood ) instead of the likelihood; the parameters that give
 the maximum log-likelihood also give the maximum likelihood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, most modelers add a frequentist interpretation to likelihoods,
 using a mathematical proof that says that, across the hypothetical repeated
 trials of the frequentist approach, the distribution of the negative logarithm
 of the likelihood itself follows a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 (“chi-squared”) distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Likelihood and classical frequentist analysis share the same philosophical
 underpinnings.
 Likelihood analysis is really a particular flavor of frequentist analysis,
 one that focuses on writing down a likelihood model and then testing for
 significant differences in the likelihood ratio rather than applying frequentis
t statistics directly to the observed outcomes.
 Classical analyses are usually easier because they are built into common
 statistics packages, and they may make fewer assumptions than likelihood
 analyses (for example, Fisher’s test is exact while the LRT is only valid
 for large data sets), but likelihood analyses are often better matched
 with ecological questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bayesian
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frequentist statistics assumes that there is a “true” state of the world
 (e.g.
 the difference between species in predation probability) which gives rise
 to a distribution of possible experimental outcomes.
 The Bayesian framework says instead that the experimental outcome — what
 we actually saw happen — is the truth, while the parameter values or hypotheses
 have probability distributions.
 The Bayesian framework solves many of the conceptual problems of frequentist
 statistics: answers depend on what we actually saw and not on a range of
 hypothetical outcomes, and we can legitimately make statements about the
 probability of different hypotheses or parameter values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Frequentists, who believe that the true value is a fixed number and uncertainty
 lies in what you observe [or might have observed], and Bayesians, who believe
 that observations are fixed numbers and the true values are uncertain.

Taking limits: what happens at either end?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Terms with larger powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 will dwarf smaller powers, and exponentials will dwarf any power.
 Exponentials are stronger than powers: 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{−n}e^{x}$
\end_inset

 eventually gets big and 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{n}e^{−x}$
\end_inset

 eventually gets small as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 increases, no matter how big 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is (exponentials always win).
 For more difficult functions that contain a fraction whose numerator and
 denominator both approach zero or infinity in some limit (and thus make
 it hard to find the limiting value), you can try L’Hopital’s Rule: 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim\frac{a(x)}{b(x)}=\lim\frac{a'(x)}{b'(x)}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsection
Taylor series approximation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Taylor series or Taylor approximation is the single most useful, and
 used, application of calculus for an ecologist.
 Two particularly useful applications of Taylor approximation are understanding
 the shapes of goodnessof-fit surfaces (Chapter 6) and the delta method
 for estimating errors in estimation (Chapter 7).
 The Taylor series allows us to approximate a complicated function near
 a point we care about, using a simple function — a polynomial with a few
 terms, say a line or a quadratic curve.
 In practice ecologists never go beyond a quadratic expansion.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)\thickapprox f(x_{0})+f'(x_{0})\cdot(x-x_{0})+f''(x_{0})\cdot\frac{(x-x_{0})^{2}}{2}+\cdots+f^{n}(x_{0})\cdot\frac{(x-x_{0})^{n}}{n!}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Taylor expansion of the exponential, 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{rx}$
\end_inset

 , around 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $1+rx+(rx)^{2}/2+(rx)^{3}/(2·3)...$
\end_inset

.
 Remembering this fact rather than working it out every time may save you
 time in the long run — for example, to understand how the Ricker function
 works for small 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 we can substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $(1−bx)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{−bx}$
\end_inset

 (dropping all but the first two terms!) to get 
\begin_inset Formula $y\thickapprox ax-abx^{2}$

Calculating Taylor approximations is often tedious (all those derivatives),
 but we usually try to do it at some special point where a lot of the complexity
 goes away (such as 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 for a logistic curve).

Probability density function: A probability distribution over a continuous
 range (such as all real numbers, or the non-negative real numbers) is called
 a 
\emph on
continuous
\emph default
 distribution.
 The 
\series bold
\emph on
cumulative distribution function
\series default
\emph default
 of a continuous distribution (
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)=Prob(X\leq x)$
\end_inset

 is easy to define and understand — it’s just the probability that the continuou
s random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is smaller than a particular value 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in any given observation or experiment — but the 
\series bold
\emph on
probability density function
\series default
\emph default
 (the analogue of the distribution function for a discrete distribution)
 is more confusing, since the probability of any precise value is zero.
 You may imagine that a measurement of (say) pH is exactly 7.9, but in fact
 what you have observed is that the pH is between 7.82 and 7.98 — if your
 meter has a precision of ± 1%.
 Thus continuous probability distributions are expressed as probability
 densities rather than probabilities — the probability that random variable
 X is between x and x + ∆x, divided by ∆x (Prob(7.82 < X < 7.98)/0.16, in this
 case).
 Dividing by ∆x allows the observed probability density to have a well-defined
 limit as precision increases and ∆x shrinks to zero.
 Unlike probabilities, Probability densities can be larger than 1 (Figure
 4.5).
 For example, if the pH probability distribution is uniform on the interval
 [7,7.1] but zero everywhere else, its probability density is 10.
 In practice, we will mostly be concerned with relative probabilities or
 likelihoods, and so the maximum density values and whether they are greater
 than or less than 1 won’t matter much.

\begin_layout Standard
In probability theory, a 
\series bold
\emph on
probability density function (pdf)
\series default
\emph default
, or density of a 
\emph on
continuous random variable
\emph default
, is a function that describes the
\emph on
 relative likelihood
\emph default
 for this random variable to take on a given value.
 The probability of the random variable falling within a particular range
 of values is given by the integral of this variable’s density over that
 range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above
 the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range.
 The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and its integral
 over the entire space is equal to one.

A

\begin_inset Formula $f_{X}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f_{X}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Pr[a\leq X\leq b]=\int_{a}^{b}f_{X}(x)dx

Hence, if 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{X}$
\end_inset

 is the

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
F_{X}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f_{X}(\mu)d\mu

 is continuous at 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{X}(x)=\frac{d}{dx}F_{X}(x)

Intuitively, one can think of

\end_inset

 as being the probability of

 falling within the infinitesimal interval

 Let

 Then for 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\mathbb{R}$

 By the axioms of probability, a probability mass function

\begin_inset Formula $F(t)=P\{X\leq t\}$

 Suppose that there exists a nonnegative, integrable function 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow[0,\infty)$

\begin_inset Formula $f_{X}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

Then the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

 We now have that for any

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Poisson
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poisson distribution gives the distribution of the number of individuals,
 arrivals, events, counts, etc., in a given time/space/unit of counting effort
 if each event is independent of all the others.
 The most common definition of the Poisson has only one parameter, the average
 density or arrival rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $λ$
\end_inset

, 
\emph on
which equals the expected number of counts in a sampling unit
\emph default
.
 An alternative parameterization gives a density per unit sampling effort
 and then specifies the mean as the product of the density per sampling
 effort 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 times the sampling effort 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $λ=rt$
\end_inset

.
 This parameterization emphasizes that even when the population density
 is constant, you can change the Poisson distribution of counts by sampling
 more extensively — for longer times or over larger quadrats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poisson distribution has no upper limit, although values much larger
 than the mean value are highly improbable.
 This characteristic provides 
\emph on
a rule for choosing between the binomial and Poisson
\emph default
.
 If you expect to observe a “ceiling” on the number of counts, you should
 use the binomial; if you expect the number of counts to be effectively
 unlimited, even if it is theoretically bounded (e.g.
 there can’t really be an infinite number of plants in your sampling quadrat),
 use the Poisson.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poisson distribution 
\emph on
only makes sense for count data
\emph default
.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $λ<1$
\end_inset

 the Poisson’s mode is at zero.
 When the expected number of counts gets large (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $λ>10$
\end_inset

) the Poisson becomes approximately normal.

Negative binomial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most probability books derive the negative binomial distribution from a
 series of independent binary (heads/tails, black/white, male/female, yes/no)
 trials that all have the same probability of success, like the binomial
 distribution.
 Rather than count the number of successes obtained in a fixed number of
 trials, which would result in a binomial distribution, the negative binomial
 counts 
\series bold
\emph on
the number of failures
\series default
\emph default
 before a predetermined number of successes occurs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This failure-process parameterization is only occasionally useful in ecological
 modeling.
 Ecologists use the negative binomial because it is discrete, like the Poisson,
 
\emph on
but its variance can be larger than its mean
\emph default
 (i.e.
 it can be 
\emph on
overdispersed
\emph default
).
 
\series bold
\emph on
Thus, it’s a good phenomenological description of a patchy or clustered
 distribution with no intrinsic upper limit that has more variance than
 the Poisson
\series default
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The “ecological” parameterization of the negative binomial replaces the
 parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 (probability of success per trial: 
\family typewriter
prob
\family default
 in R) and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 (number of successes before you stop counting failures: 
\family typewriter
size
\family default
 in R) with 
\begin_inset Formula $µ=n(1−p)/p$
\end_inset

, the mean number of failures expected (or of counts in a sample: 
\family typewriter
mu
\family default
 in R), and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, which is typically called an 
\emph on
overdispersion parameter
\emph default
.
 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p\rightarrow\mu,\:n\rightarrow k$
\end_inset

).
 Confusingly, 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is also called 
\family typewriter
size
\family default
 in R, because it is mathematically equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in the failure-process parameterization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overdispersion parameter measures the amount of clustering, or aggregation,
 or heterogeneity, in the data: 
\emph on
a smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 means more heterogeneity
\emph default
.
 The variance of the negative binomial distribution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu+\mu^{2}/k$
\end_inset

, and 
\emph on
so as 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 becomes large the variance approaches the mean and the distribution approaches
 the Poisson distribution.

\emph default
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $k>10$
\end_inset

, the negative binomial is hard to tell from a Poisson distribution, but
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is often less than 1 in ecological applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically, you can get a negative binomial distribution as the result
 of a Poisson sampling process where the rate 
\begin_inset Formula $λ$
\end_inset

 itself varies.
 If the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a gamma distribution with shape parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is Poisson-distributed with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, then the distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 be a negative binomial distribution with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and overdispersion parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 (May, 1978; Hilborn and Mangel, 1997).
 In this case, the negative binomial reflects unmeasured (“random”) variability
 in the population.

\begin_layout Standard
Negative binomial distributions can also result from a homogeneous birth-death
 process, births and deaths (and immigrations) occurring at random in continuous
 time.
 Samples from a population that starts from 0 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, with immigration rate 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, birth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, and death rate 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 will be negative binomially distributed with parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=i/(b−d)(e^{(b−d)t}−1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k=i/b$
\end_inset

 (Bailey, 1964, p.
 99).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several different ecological processes can often generate the same probability
 distribution.
 We can usually reason forward from knowledge of probable mechanisms operating
 in the field to plausible distributions for modeling data, but this many-to-one
 relationship suggests that it is unsafe to reason backwards from probability
 distributions to particular mechanisms that generate them.

Beta-Binomial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as one can compound the Poisson distribution with a Gamma to allow
 for heterogeneity in rates, producing a negative binomial, one can compound
 the binomial distribution with a Beta distribution to allow for heterogeneity
 in per-trial probability, producing a Beta-binomial distribution (Crowder,
 1978; Reeve and Murdoch, 1985; Hatfield et al., 1996).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
most common
\emph default
 parameterization of the beta-binomial distribution uses the binomial parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 (trials per sample), plus two additional parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 that describe the beta distribution of the per-trial probability.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b=1$
\end_inset

 the per-trial probability is equally likely to be any value between 0 and
 1 (the mean is 0.5), and the beta-binomial gives a uniform (discrete) distributi
on between 0 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 .
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $a+b$
\end_inset

 increases, the variance of the underlying heterogeneity decreases and the
 beta-binomial converges to the 
\emph on
binomial
\emph default
 distribution.
 Morris (1997) suggests a different parameterization that uses an overdispersion
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $θ$
\end_inset

, like the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 parameter of the negative binomial distribution.
 In this case the parameters are 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 , the per-trial probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p=a/(a+b)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $θ=a+b$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $θ$
\end_inset

 is large (small overdispersion), the beta-binomial becomes binomial.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $θ$
\end_inset

 is near zero (large overdispersion), the beta-binomial becomes U-shaped.

\begin_inset Formula $1/(b−a)$

 is surprisingly rarely used in ecology otherwise.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Gamma distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The Gamma distribution is the distribution of 
\emph on
waiting times
\emph default
 until a certain number of events take place.
 
\series default
For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $Gamma(shape=3,scale=2)$
\end_inset

 is the distribution of the length of time (in days) you’d expect to have
 to wait for 3 deaths in a population, given that the average survival time
 is 2 days (mortality rate is 1/2 per day).
 The mean waiting time is 6 days = 3 deaths/(1/2 death per day).
 Gamma distributions with integer shape parameters are also called 
\emph on
Erlang
\emph default
 distributions.
 The Gamma distribution is still defined for non-integer (positive) shape
 parameters, but the simple description given above breaks down: how can
 you define the waiting time until 3.2 events take place?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For shape parameters ≤ 1, the Gamma has its mode at zero; for shape parameter
 = 1, the Gamma is equivalent to the exponential (see below).
 For shape parameter greater than 1, the Gamma has a peak (mode) at a value
 greater than zero; as the shape parameter increases, the Gamma distribution
 becomes more symmetrical and approaches the normal distribution.
 This behavior makes sense if you think of the Gamma as the distribution
 of the sum of independent, identically distributed waiting times, in which
 case it is governed by the Central Limit Theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scale parameter (sometimes defined in terms of a rate parameter instead,
 1/scale) just adjusts the mean of the Gamma by adjusting the waiting time
 per event; however, multiplying the waiting time by a constant to adjust
 its mean also changes the variance, so both the variance and the mean depend
 on the scale parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gamma distribution is less familiar than the normal, and new users of
 the Gamma often find it annoying that in the standard parameterization
 you can’t adjust the mean independently of the variance.
 You could define a new set of parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 (mean) and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 (variance), with scale = 
\begin_inset Formula $v/m$
\end_inset

 and shape = 
\begin_inset Formula $m^{2}/v$
\end_inset

 — but then you would find (unlike the normal distribution) the shape changing
 as you changed the variance.
 Nevertheless, the Gamma is extremely useful; it solves the problem that
 many researchers face when they have a continuous variable with “
\emph on
too much variance
\emph default
”, whose coefficient of variation is greater than about 0.5.
 Modeling such data with a normal distribution leads to unrealistic negative
 values, which then have to be dealt with in some ad hoc way like truncating
 them or otherwise trying to ignore them.
 The Gamma is often a more realistic alternative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gamma is the continuous counterpart of the negative binomial, which
 is the discrete distribution of a number of trials (rather than length
 of time) until a certain number of events occur.
 Both the negative binomial and Gamma distributions are often generalized,
 however, in ways that don’t necessarily make sense according to their simple
 mechanistic descriptions (e.g.
 a Gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 2.3 corresponds to the distributi
on of waiting times until 2.3 events occur .
 .
 .
 ).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gamma and negative binomial are both commonly used phenomenologically,
 as skewed or overdispersed versions of the Poisson or normal distributions,
 rather than for their mechanistic descriptions.
 
\series bold
\emph on
The Gamma is less widely used than the negative binomial
\emph default
 because the negative binomial replaces the Poisson, which is restricted
 to a particular variance, while the Gamma replaces the normal, which can
 have any variance.
 Thus you might use the negative binomial for any discrete distribution
 with variance > mean, while you wouldn’t need a Gamma distribution unless
 the distribution you were trying to match was skewed to the right.

Beta
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta distribution is a continuous distribution closely related to the
 binomial distribution.
 
\emph on
The beta distribution is the only standard continuous distribution (besides
 the uniform distribution) with a finite range, from 0 to 1.

\emph default
 
\series bold
The beta distribution is the inferred distribution of the probability of
 success in a binomial trial with 
\begin_inset Formula $a-1$
\end_inset

 observed successes and 
\begin_inset Formula $b-1$
\end_inset

 observed failures.

\series default
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b$
\end_inset

 the distribution is symmetric around 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0.5$
\end_inset

, when 
\begin_inset Formula $a<b$
\end_inset

 the peak shifts toward zero, and when 
\begin_inset Formula $a>b$
\end_inset

 it shifts toward 1.
 
\emph on
With 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b=1$
\end_inset

, the distribution is 
\begin_inset Formula $U(0,1)$
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $a+b$
\end_inset

 (equivalent to the total number of trials
\begin_inset Formula $+2$
\end_inset

) gets larger, the distribution becomes more peaked.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 less than 1, the mechanistic description stops making sense (how can you
 have fewer than zero trials?), but the distribution is still well-defined,
 and when a and b are both between 0 and 1 it becomes U-shaped — it has
 peaks at 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta distribution is obviously good for modeling probabilities or proportion
s.
 It can also be useful for modeling continuous distributions with peaks
 at both ends, although in some cases a finite mixture model may be more
 appropriate.
 The beta distribution is also useful whenever you have to define a continuous
 distribution on a finite range, as it is the only such standard continuous
 distribution.
 It’s easy to rescale the distribution so that it applies over some other
 finite range instead of from 0 to 1: for example, Tiwari et al.
 (2005) used the beta distribution to describe the distribution of turtles
 on a beach, so the range would extend from 0 to the length of the beach.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lognormal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its mechanistic justification is like the normal distribution (the Central
 Limit Theorem), but for the product of many independent, identical variates
 rather than their sum.
 Just as taking logarithms converts products into sums, taking the logarithm
 of a lognormally distributed variable—which might result from the product
 of independent variables—converts it it into a normally distributed variable
 resulting from the sum of the logarithms of those independent variables.
 The best example of this mechanism is the distribution of the sizes of
 individuals or populations that grow exponentially, with a per capita growth
 rate that varies randomly over time.
 At each time step (daily, yearly, etc.), the current size is multiplied
 by the randomly chosen growth increment, so the final size (when measured)
 is the product of the initial size and all of the random growth increments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The log-normal is also used phenomenologically in some of the same situations
 where a Gamma distribution also fits: continuous, positive distributions
 with long tails or variance much greater than the mean (McGill et al., 2006).
 Like the distinction between a Michaelis-Menten and a saturating exponential,
 you may not be able to tell the difference between a lognormal and a Gamma
 without large amounts of data.
 Use the one that is more convenient, or that corresponds to a more plausible
 mechanism for your data.

Likelihood and all that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous chapters have introduced all the ingredients you need to define
 a model — mathematical functions to describe the deterministic patterns
 and probability distributions to describe the stochastic patterns — and
 shown how to use these ingredients to simulate simple ecological systems.
 However, you need to learn not only how to construct models but also how
 to estimate parameters from data, and how to test models against each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, to estimate the parameters of a model we have to find the parameters
 that make that model fit the data best.
 To compare among models we have to figure out which one fits the data best,
 and decide if one or more models fit sufficiently much better than the
 rest that we can declare them the winners.
 Our goodness-of-fit metrics will be based on the 
\series bold
\emph on
likelihood, the probability of seeing the data we actually collected given
 a particular model
\series default
\emph default
 — which in this case will mean both the general form of the model and the
 specific parameter values.

 most likely to have happened.
 
\emph on

\emph default
 data, so the joint likelohood of the wholde data set is the product of
 the likelihood of each individual observation.
 For mathmatical convience, we take the logarithm of the likelihood.
 Since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the maximum
 log-likelihood estimate is the same as the maximum likelihood estimate.
 Actually, it is conventional to 
\series bold
\emph on
minimize
\series default
\emph default
 the 
\emph on

\emph default
 rather than maximizing the log-likelihood.
 For continuous probability distributions, we compute the probability density
 of observing the data rather than the probability itself.
 Since we are interested in relative (log)likelihoods, not the absolute
 probability of observing the data, we can ignore the distinction between
 the density (
\begin_inset Formula $P(x)$
\end_inset

) and the probability (which includes a term for the measurement precision:
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x)dx$

 “trials” (exposed tadpoles), the posterior distribution is a Beta distribution
 with shape parameters

\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $b+(nN−\sum k)$

 If we interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $a−1$
\end_inset

 as the total number of previously observed successes and 
\begin_inset Formula $b−1$
\end_inset

 as the number of previously observed failures, then the new distribution
 just combines the total number of successes and failures in the complete
 (prior plus current) data set.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b=1$
\end_inset

, the Beta distribution is flat, corresponding to no prior information (
\begin_inset Formula $a−1=b−1=0$
\end_inset

).
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, we get a very peculiar prior distribution with infinite spikes at 0 and
 1.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 increase, the prior distribution gains more information and becomes peaked.
 We can also see that, as far as a Bayesian is concerned, it doesn’t matter
 how we divide our experiments up.
 Many small experiments, aggregated with successive uses of Bayes’ Rule,
 give the same information as one big experiment (provided of course that
 there is no variation in pertrial probability among sets of observations,
 which we have assumed in our statistical model for both the likelihood
 and the Bayesian analysis).

and use integrate (for 1-dimensional integrals) or adapt (in the adapt package;
 for multi-dimensional integrals) to do the integration.
 More crudely, we can approximate the integral by a sum, calculating values
 of the integrand for discrete values.
 However, integrating probabilities is tricky for two reasons.
 (1) Prior probabilities and likelihoods are often tiny for some parameter
 values, leading to roundoff error; tricks like calculating log-probabilities
 for the prior and likelihood, adding, and then exponentiating can help.
 (2) You must pick the number and range of points at which to evaluate the
 integral carefully.
 Too coarse a grid leads to approximation error, which may be severe if
 the function has sharp peaks.
 Too small a range, or the wrong range, can miss important parts of the
 surface.
 In practice, brute-force numerical integration is no longer feasible with
 models with more than about two parameters.
 The only practical alternatives are Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches.

 worse fits.

\begin_inset Formula $L_{abs}=L(\hat{p}_{1},\hat{p}_{2},...,\hat{p}_{n})$
\end_inset

 (“abs” stands for “absolute”).
 Now fix some of the parameters (say 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}...p_{r}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}^{∗},...p_{r}^{∗}$
\end_inset

 Thus, for univariate confidence limits we cut off the likelihood profile

The LRT is only correct asymptotically, for large data sets.
 For small data sets it is an approximation, although one that people use
 very freely.
 The other limitation of the LRT that frequently arises, although it is
 often ignored, is that it only works when the best estimate of the parameter
 is not on the edge of its allowable range (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000).
 For example, if you are fitting an exponential model 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\exp(rx)$
\end_inset

 that must be decreasing, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $r\leq0$
\end_inset

, and your best estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$

 is equal to 0, then the LRT estimate for the upper bound of the confidence

\begin_layout Subsection
Bayesian approach: posterior distribution and marginal distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of drawing likelihood curves, Bayesians draw the posterior distribution
 (proportional to prior × L).
 Instead of calculating confidence limits using the (frequentist) LRT, they
 define the 
\emph on
credible interval
\emph default
, which is the region in the center of the distribution containing 95% (or
 some other standard proportion) of the probability of the distribution,
 
\emph on
bounded by values on either side that have the 
\series bold
same
\series default
 probability 
\emph default
(or probability density).
 Technically, the credible interval is the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[x_{1},x_{2}]$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x_{1})=P(x_{2})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C(x_{2})−C(x_{1})=1−α$
\end_inset

, where P is the probability density and C is the cumulative density.
 The credible interval is slightly different from the frequentist confidence
 interval, which is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $[x_{1},x_{2}]$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $C(x_{1})=α/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C(x_{2})=1−α/2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on

 Where frequentists use likelihood profiles to make inferences about a single

 Bayesians use the marginal posterior probability density, the overall probabili

 parameters.

Comparing models

\begin_layout Standard
Parsimony (sometimes called “Occam’s razor”) is a general argument for choosing
 simpler models even though we know the world is complex.
 All other things being equal, we should prefer a simpler model to a more
 complex one — especially when the data don’t tell a clear story.
 Model selection approaches typically go beyond parsimony to say that a
 more complex model must be not just better than, but a specified amount
 better than, a simpler model.
 If the more complex model doesn’t exceed a threshold of improvement in
 fit (we will see below exactly where this threshold comes from), we typically
 reject it in favor of the simpler model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model complexity also affects our predictive ability.
 Walters and Ludwig (1981) simulated fish population dynamics using a complex
 agestructured model and showed that in many cases, when data were realistically
 sparse and noisy, they could best predict future (simulated) dynamics using
 a simpler non-age-structured model.
 In other words, even though they knew for sure that juveniles and adults
 had different mortality rates (because they simulated the data from a model
 with mortality differences), a model that ignored this distinction gave
 more accurate predictions.
 This apparent paradox is an example of the 
\series bold
\emph on
bias-variance tradeoff 
\series default
\emph default
introduced in Chapter 5.
 As we add more parameters to a model, we necessarily get an increasingly
 precise fit to the particular data we have observed (the bias decreases),
 but our accuracy for predicting future observations decreases as well (the
 variance increases).
 Data contain a fixed amount of information; as we estimate more and more
 parameters we spread the data thinner and thinner.
 Eventually the gain in precision from having more details in the model
 is outweighed by the loss in accuracy from estimating the effect of each
 of those details more poorly.
 In Ludwig and Walters’s case, spreading the data out across age classes
 meant there was not enough data to estimate each age class’s dynamics accuratel
y.

\begin_layout Subsection
Likelihood ratio test: nested models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons among different groups can also be framed as a comparison of
 nested models.
 If the more complex model has the mean of group 1 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $a1$
\end_inset

 and the mean of group 2 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $a2$
\end_inset

 , then the nested model (both groups equivalent) applies when 
\begin_inset Formula $a1=a2$
\end_inset

 .
 It is also common to parameterize this model as 
\begin_inset Formula $a2=a1+δ12$
\end_inset

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $δ12=a2−a1$
\end_inset

 , so that the simpler model applies when 
\begin_inset Formula $δ12=0$
\end_inset

.
 This parameterization works better for model comparisons since testing
 the hypothesis that the more complex model is better becomes a test of
 the value of one parameter (
\begin_inset Formula $δ12=0?$
\end_inset

) rather than a test of the relationship between two parameters (
\begin_inset Formula $a1=a2$
\end_inset

 ?).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Likelihood Ratio Test can compare any two nested models, testing whether
 the nesting parameters of the more complex model differ significantly from
 their null values.
 Put another way, the LRT tests whether the extra goodness of fit to the
 data is worth the added complexity of the additional parameters.
 To use the LRT to compare models, compare the difference in deviances (the
 more complex model should always have a smaller deviance — if not, check
 for problems with the optimization) to the critical value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $χ^{2}$
\end_inset

 distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to the additional number of
 parameters in the more complex model.
 If the difference in deviances is greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $χ_{n2−n1}^{2}(1−α)$
\end_inset

, then the more complex model is significantly better at the 
\begin_inset Formula $p=α$
\end_inset

 level.
 If not, then the additional complexity is not justified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choosing among statistical distributions can often be reduced to comparing
 among nested models.

\begin_layout Standard
One way to avoid having to make pairwise model comparisons is to select
 models based on 
\emph on
information criteria
\emph default
, which compare all candidate models at once and do not require nested alternati

 These relatively recent alternatives to likelihood ratio tests are based
 on the expected distance (quantified in a way that comes from information
 theory) between a particular model and the “true” model (Burnham and Anderson,
 1998, 2002).
 In practice, all information-theoretic methods reduce to the finding the
 model that minimizes some criterion that is the sum of a term based on
 the likelihood (usually twice the negative log-likelihood) and a 
\emph on
penalty term
\emph default
 which is different for different information criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
For all information criteria, small values represent better overall fits.

The

\begin_inset Formula $AIC=-2L+2k$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the log-likelihood and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the number of parameters in the model.
 For small sample sizes (n) — such as when n/k < 40 (Burnham and Anderson,

The second most common information criterion, the

 or

 (SC/BIC) ∗ , uses a penalty term of

 When n is greater than

 observations (so that log n > 2), the BIC is more conservative than the
 AIC, insisting on a greater improvement in fit before it will accept a
 more complex model.

\begin_layout Standard
Information criteria do not allow frequentist significance tests based on
 the estimated probability of getting more extreme results in repeated experimen
ts (some statisticians would say this is an advantage).

With ICs, you cannot say that there is a statistically significant difference

 with how much better it is.
 Instead, there are

commonly used rules of thumb

models with ICs less than 2 apart (∆IC < 2) are more or less equivalent;
 those with ICs 4-7 apart are clearly distinguishable; and models with ICs
 more than 10 apart are definitely different

.
 Richards (2005) concurs with these recommendations, but cautions that simply
 dropping models with ∆AIC > 2 (as some ecologists do) will probably discard
 useful models.

\begin_layout Standard
One big advantage of IC-based approaches is that they do not require nested
 models.
 You can compare all models to each other, rather than stepping through
 a sometimes confusing sequence of pairwise tests.
 In ICbased approaches, you simply compute the likelihood and IC for all
 of the candidate models and rank them in order of increasing IC.
 The model with the lowest IC is the best fit to the data; those models
 with ICs within 10 units of the minimum IC are worth considering.
 As with the LRT, the absolute size of the ICs is unimportant — only the
 differences in ICs matter.

Bayesian analyses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bayesians are on the whole less interested in formal methods of model selection.
 Dropping a parameter from a model is often equivalent to testing a null
 hypothesis that the parameter is exactly zero, and Bayesians consider such
 point null hypotheses silly.
 They would describe a parameter’s distribution as being concentrated near
 zero rather than saying its value is exactly zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marginal likelihood of a model is the probability of observing the data
 (likelihood), averaged over the prior distribution of the parameters:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{L}=\int L(x)\cdot Prior(x)dx
\]

\end_inset

where x represents a parameter or set of parameters (if a set, then the
 integral would be a multiple integral).
 The marginal likelihood (the average probability of observing a particular
 data set exactly ) is often very small, and we are really interested in
 the relative probability of different models.
 If we have two models with marginal likelihoods 
\begin_inset Formula $ˆL1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ˆL2$
\end_inset

, the 
\emph on
Bayes factor
\emph default
 is the ratio of the marginal likelihoods, 
\begin_inset Formula $B12=ˆL1/ˆL2$
\end_inset

 , or the odds in favor of model 1.

\begin_layout Standard
A more recent criterion, conveniently built into WinBUGS, is the DIC or
 
\emph on
deviance information criterion
\emph default
, which was designed particularly for models containing random effects where
 even specifying the number of parameters is confusing.

\begin_layout Subsection
Model weighting and averaging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bayesians themselves would say that you should not simply select one model.
 Taking the best model and ignoring the rest is equivalent to assigning
 a probability of 1.0 to the best and 0.0 to the rest.
 Model averaging methods take the average of the predictions of different
 models, weighted by the probability of the models or by some other index.
